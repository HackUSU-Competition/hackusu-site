- Registration pricing, what's included in registration (remove references to free event)
- Downloadable images for press use
- Update README, my contact information
- Add Social Share Preview file
- Update volunteer opportunities when we determine how to pick president and vice president
- Update with information involving business students' proposals
- Photos probably won't be a top level page, link to it from somewhere else
