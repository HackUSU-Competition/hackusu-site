# TODO

- main.css isn't being used everywhere
- Downloadable images for press use
- Add Social Share Preview file
- Update logo to say 2024
- Add favicon
- Update quotes on the press page and sponsor page with feedback from 2023
- Create page with more detailed competition info (rules, judging, etc.)
- Registration pricing, what's included in registration (remove references to free event)
- Update README, my contact information
- Update with information involving business students' proposals
- Photos probably won't be a top level page, link to it from somewhere else
- Figure out why gatsby-plugin-mantine isn't working, had to add gatsby-ssr.js manually

- ? Dynamically load current and previous sponsor logos
