          We're HackUSU, Utah's largest and oldest student-run hackathon. Each year, hundreds of

          You won't find malicious basement hackers trying to break into private servers at
          hackathons. Hackathons are weekend-long events hosted by a variety of universities and
          colleges across the country who pride themselves on encouraging students to 'hack' a
          solution to difficult technical problems. The 'hackathon' nomenclature has risen in recent
          years to represent student collaboration and interaction around hardware and software.
