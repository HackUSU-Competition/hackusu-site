        We're HackUSU, Utah's largest and oldest student-run hackathon. Each year, hundreds of
        student developers, engineers, and data analysts meet at Utah State University to unite for
        a weekend of building and collaboration. We'll have competitions and workshops related to
        many topics from game development and data analytics to hardware and security.

        You won't find malicious basement hackers trying to break into private servers at
        hackathons. Hackathons are weekend-long events hosted by a variety of universities and
        colleges across the country who pride themselves on encouraging students to 'hack' a
        solution to difficult technical problems. The 'hackathon' nomenclature has risen in recent
        years to represent student collaboration and interaction around hardware and software.
